# PyTorch-Projects
A few small Projects developed using PyTorch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.FASHION-MNIST-PyTorch : A simple Multi Layer Perceptron network to classify images
                          in the FASHION-MNIST dataset.
                    
2.Facial Key Points Detection: A CNN model that can detect and highlight facial Key
                               Points.
                              
3.DETR End-End Object Detection: A demo of the most recent Object Detection model from
                                 Facebook.(Note: I didn't recreated this model. I just 
                                 added some functions for evaluating the model.)
